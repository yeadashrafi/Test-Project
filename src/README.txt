TimeClock Application:

This is a simple java application for employees to login to the system to start their shift, lunch, break and end the shift.

Constraint:

- This app currently does not have any admin functionality.
- Employee IDs are pre generated by system. Valid employee IDs are range 101-110.
- One employee can use the application at a time. (User should think of this as their personal timeClock app)

User guidance:

- Upon starting the application, user will be asked to give valid employee ID.
    - Without valid employee ID, user will not be allowed in the application.
- After successful login, user will have 3 options to choose from (end shift, lunch and break)
- When taking lunch and break, user will not be allowed to end the shift.
    - Even end shift option is chosen, user will be prompted to end their lunch or break.
- End shift option will end the application and log user off from the application.
    - After successfully ending the shift, user will be given total hours they worked and data shift log.
